A. Names: Nirman Dave, Mei Zhou, Alina Dao
Description: use momentum optimization with a momentum of 0.9, learning rate 0.001
Summary of Results:
Number of epochs to reach a validation accuracy of 0.4: Epoch 9

Description: Compare the original pooling to compare this to tf.nn.avg_pool

Notes:
tf.nn_avg_pool() worked much better than the original pooling. Not only did it get to a high validation and test accuracy much faster than the original pooling, it also avoided overfitting for many more epochs. Although the accuracy was lower at 100 epochs, this is because the accuracy fluctuated from .64 - .65 until the 115 epoch, then overfitting drove the accuracy down gradually (much less gradual than the original).

tf.nn_avg_pool() statistics:
Number of epochs to reach a validation accuracy of 0.4: Epoch 1
