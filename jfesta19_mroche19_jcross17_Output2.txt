Description: Use momentum optimization with a momentum of 0,9, learning rate 0.1
Number of epochs to reach a validation accuracy of 0.4: 3 epochs

So, initially we ran the code with the parameters given to us which was Momentum Optimizer of 0.9 with a learning rate of 0.1. We found that the accuracy go stuck at approximately 0.1 for 3 epochs. So, we shut it down and tried both a new seed to a completely random number of 7812 and a new learning rate. The group who had this momentum task for the first assignemnt told us that 0.5 worked well for them. We tried this as well as a learning rate for of 0.75. Both worked well but we decided to submit the results that are with a momentum of 0.75. The learning rate remained 0.1 for the all of thee experiments. 

Here are the results: we reached an accuracy of 0.4 after the third epoch.
